  <div class="grid-item"><div class="sub_head">Simple Cues Lead to a Strong Multi-Object Tracker (CVPR Workshop 2023)</div><div class="block_text">  I talked about our CVPR 2023 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04656.pdf">"GHOST: Simple Cues Lead to a Strong Multi-Object Tracker"</a> in the "Tracking and Its Many Guises" Workshop. It was super fun to get roasted by questions and listen to all the other amazing talks. Find the list of speakers and talks <a href="http://taodataset.org/workshop/cvpr23/">here</a> and a similar presentation to the one I gave in the workshop on the right.</div></div>

  <div class="grid-item"><div class="sub_head">Tutorial on Deep Visual Similarity and Metric Learning (CVPR 2022)</div><div class="block_text">  Together with Timo Milbich and Bj√∂rn Ommer from Ludwigs Maximilians University Munich, we gave an introduction on learning visual similarity, the different objective functions that can be used, best practices as well as its wide variety of usages! Find the recording of the talks below and the slides <a href="https://dvsml2022-tutorial.github.io/index.html">here</a>. </div></div>

  <div class="grid-item"><div class="sub_head">"Learning Inta-Batch Connections for Deep Metric Learning" (ICML 2021)</div><div class="block_text">  I presented my first ever top-tier conference <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07753">paper</a> at ICML 2021! We proposed an approach based on message passing networks that takes all the relations in a mini-batch into account to refine embedding vectors. Since it was still an online conference, we at least now have the recording of my presentation! </div></div>
